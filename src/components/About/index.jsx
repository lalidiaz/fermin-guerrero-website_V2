        projects across different platforms and disciplines. His work has received many prestigious
        prizes and awards and has been regularly highlighted by the most relevant international
        design press. From 2015 to 2018, Guerrero taught a variety of Graphic Design and Typography
        related courses at HEAD–Geneva. His curiosity, which has led him to move out of his country
        in the quest for personal and professional development, keeps him constantly searching for
        new ways to express his ideas. He is currently based in the UAE, since 2018, where he has
        been appointed the Senior Graphic Designer at{" "}
